Part of the assignment and labs I did in this course. All the assignments I got over 95%. You are more than welcome to look into it, but not copy it before you understand. Looking into others code is always a good way to learn, but without understanding it wont do anything good for you!

The codes are packed into Jars, you can look into the code after download it. Maybe I will upload the java file later on. 

For now, I will just stay with it.
Again you are more than welcome to look into my code, but dont just copy it, it may get you in trouble.
